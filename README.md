The synthetic data mode, for demonstration and testing, is available from the context menu in the upper-right corner.

It provides a realistic user experience, demonstrating the application's capabilities with up to 60 days of generated synthetic data.
The data is produced on-the-fly for demonstration purposes and is not stored or saved.

## All Your Heart Rate Data in One Place

Our app is designed to give you complete control over your health data.

- Expand graphs horizontally and vertically to view your data in detail.
- A swipe gesture, in the middle of the graph, tucks away the extra date and time information.
- Quickly navigate to any time with the calendar.

In the live version of our app available on TestFlight, any data deleted from one device syncs across to all others, ensuring complete privacy for your health data.

We would love to hear your thoughts and experiences as you embark on your heart's journey.

Our application is powered by cutting-edge technology including Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, Core Data, HealthKit, and CloudKit.
Our commitment is to deliver an excellent, state-of-the-art health data tracking experience for our users.
