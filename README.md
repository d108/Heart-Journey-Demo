Experience a personalized, visual journey through your health data with our innovative application.
Seamlessly designed for both iOS and macOS, our app offers smooth and fast health data tracking like no other.

Try our [universal binary demo, compatible with macOS Ventura (13.0) and later, fully notarized by Apple.](https://github.com/d108/Heart-Journey-Demo/releases/latest)

Please note, the synthetic data used in the demo is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent any actual health data.

Our demo provides a realistic user experience, demonstrating the application's capabilities with up to 60 days of generated synthetic data.
The data is produced on-the-fly for demonstration purposes and is not stored or saved.

## All Your Heart Rate Data in One Place

Our app is designed to give you complete control over your health data.

- Expand graphs horizontally and vertically to view your data in detail.
- A swipe gesture, in the middle of the graph, tucks away the extra date and time information.
- Quickly navigate to any time with the calendar.

In the live version of our app available on TestFlight, any data deleted from one device syncs across to all others, ensuring complete privacy for your health data.

We would love to hear your thoughts and experiences as you embark on your heart's journey.
